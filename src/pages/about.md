# History

At first, this blog was created to learn about the Static Website Generator named [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), that uses the `Ruby` ​​programming language.

After some time, I decided to change it to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), that uses the `Node`/`JavaScript` ​​programming language, because it is a technology that I am more used to and it has some other nice features.
