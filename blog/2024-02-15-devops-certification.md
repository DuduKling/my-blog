Just a part of the "Mind Map" I created on my journey to get the `EXIN DevOps Professional`, also known as `DEVOPSP`, certification.

See my certification badge [here](https://app.exeed.pro/holder/badge/168853).

## About the certification

The definition of certification is as follow:

> This EXIN DevOps Professional certification has been designed to test IT professionals on their background knowledge and understanding of essential DevOps practices. Created as a stepping-stone to the EXIN DevOps Master certification, this certification looks at the Three Ways, the good habits of change control, and maintaining security compliance.
