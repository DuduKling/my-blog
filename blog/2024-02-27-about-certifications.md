Just a few thoughts on certifications:

Certifications are a very controversial topic, but I really couldn't care less.

I see certifications as a way to continually acquiring new knowledge and applying it everywhere.

A professional's competences are mix of knowledge, skill, and attitude.

What I see as a good professional, is someone who continually invests in their self-development, acquires new knowledge, applies their knowledge by delivering to the environment they are working in, and, most importantly, invests in their soft skills.
