Just a part of the "Mind Map" I created on my journey to get the `AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner`, also known as `CCP`, certification.

See my certification badge [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/01ae0295-4d60-4276-b6c2-d2f17abb84f2/public_url).

## About the certification

The definition of certification is as follow:

> The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner validates foundational, high-level understanding of AWS Cloud, services, and terminology.  This is a good starting point on the AWS Certification journey for individuals with no prior IT or cloud experience switching to a cloud career or for line-of-business employees looking for foundational cloud literacy.
